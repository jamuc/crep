# Goals

- Add templating support for reports to easily create a readable and actionable format for sharing crashes.
- Add multiple crash sources, making it easier for anyone to plug and play.
- Enable newsletters or results to be easily published on sites like GitHub.
- Cultivate an inclusive open source community through respectful discussion.

# Scope

- We are focusing on crashes for a specific app version.
- We do not expect adding crash visualisations.

## Inspiration

This project is inspired by our effort to share crash insights and cultivate teams to feel repsonsibility to fix them at [XING](https://www.xing.com) and aims to raise awareness and fix crashes across all teams.
